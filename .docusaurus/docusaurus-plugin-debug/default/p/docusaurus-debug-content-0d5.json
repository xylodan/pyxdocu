One fundamental purpose of this protocol is to give greenwashing nowhere to hide.\r\nAt PYX, we believe in the power of transparency to revolutionize supply chains and foster trust across industries. Our articles aim to provide you with valuable information, practical insights, and thought-provoking discussions on implementing UNTP and navigating the future of digital trust.\r\n\r\nPyx co-founder, Steven Capell, is a key contributor to the development of UNTP.
