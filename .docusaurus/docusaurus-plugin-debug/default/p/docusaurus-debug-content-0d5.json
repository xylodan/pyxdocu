UNTP Extensions Methodology Published](#untp-extensions-methodology-published)\r\n\r\n#### [2. Transmute Achieves UNTP 0.5 Compliance](#transmute-achieves-untp-05-compliance)\r\n\r\n### UNTP Extensions Methodology Published\r\n\r\nIn a significant development, the United Nations Trade Platform (UNTP) has released the first draft of the **Extensions Methodology**. This methodology is designed to enhance the adaptability and interoperability of its core system, setting a standard to accommodate specific industry and regulatory needs while maintaining seamless cross-industry and cross-border compatibility.\r\n<!-- truncate -->\r\n\r\nThe updated methodology emphasizes open governance, ensuring that all extensions adhere to transparent processes and remain freely available. It outlines comprehensive guidelines for schema and vocabulary extensions, identifier schemes, and conformity criteria, ensuring alignment with relevant standards and regulations.\r\n\r\n**From the Article**:\r\n\r\n> \"UNTP is designed as a common core that is usable by any industry sector or in any regulatory jurisdiction. This extensions methodology describes how to extend UNTP to meet the specific needs of any industry sector or regulated market in such a way that the extension maintains core interoperability with any other extension. This cross-industry and cross-border interoperability is a core value of UNTP because almost every value chain will cross industry and/or national borders.\"\r\n\r\n![Key Highlights](./241031graphic.png)\r\n\r\nKey highlights of the release include:\r\n- **New Schema Extensions**: Introduction of additional properties for enhanced flexibility.\r\n- **Industry-Specific Vocabulary**: Use of JSON-LD @context files for customized vocabulary.\r\n- **Identifier Registration**: A clear framework for identifier schemes, promoting standardization.\r\n- **Alignment with Standards Bodies**: Collaboration with organizations like ISO to maintain global compatibility.\r\n\r\nUNTPâ€™s commitment to open development is further reinforced through its collaboration with standards bodies, ensuring the platform aligns with global initiatives. This update is expected to foster greater participation from various industry sectors and national projects, solidifying UNTP's role as a vital tool for international trade and cooperation.\r\n\r\nFor more information, stakeholders are encouraged to review the updated methodology and participate in the ongoing development process.
