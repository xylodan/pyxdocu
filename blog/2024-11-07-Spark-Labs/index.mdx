Pyx was featured as part of SparkLab Cultiv8’s 2024 Showcase because we are pioneering Trust Architecture in Australia's agriculture sector and in the global marketplace. What does that mean?

PyxGlobal addresses global supply chain transparency, focused on how organisations share high-quality information so that they can outcompete on the great work that they do for their customers, for their employees, and related to environmental social and governance (ESG) concerns.

In the agriculture sector, we’re providing farmers and farms the ability to demonstrate their high-quality goods and services in both domestic and overseas markets through the sharing of ESG / clean and green credentials that they've built over the years.

At PyxGlobal, we're working to accelerate a global marketplace where organisations and communities can trade, compete, differentiate, and gain market access based on their sustainability credentials.

We're working to enable that information to be shared in a way that provides and creates the incentives for ag sector participants to improve the quality of their carbon tracking and, ultimately, decrease the emissions that they create as part of their production systems.

If this is something that sparks your interest or aligns with work you are doing, why not hop on over to the Pyx Community Forum and kick off a discussion about it?
