## Pyx Co-Founder Steve Capell Presents UN/CEFACT Recommendation 49

If you're ready to consider and participate in traceability and supply chain transparency at scale, you need to know about the UN Transparency Protocol (UNTP).
<!-- truncate -->
A team of volunteer global experts - including the founders of PyxGlobal - have been supporting UN/CEFACT to develop a new protocol (not a platform, tool or piece of tech) to enable interoperable supply chain traceability and transparency at scale. One fundamental purpose of this protocol is to give greenwashing nowhere to hide.
At PYX, we believe in the power of transparency to revolutionize supply chains and foster trust across industries. Our articles aim to provide you with valuable information, practical insights, and thought-provoking discussions on implementing UNTP and navigating the future of digital trust.

Pyx co-founder, Steven Capell, is a key contributor to the development of UNTP. He's one of the best sources for an explanation about how it is changing the game for governments and industry worldwide as we collectively tackle greenwashing and ESG compliance reporting.
