# Trust Architecture Introduction

In its simplest form, a Trust Architect is a Process Engineer and a Project Manager in one who connects the software with the process.  The concept of a Trust Architect is a new term that Pyx uses to describe those of us looking to solve the current scalability and transparency weaknesses of the current global supply chain model.  Think of UNTP for the supply chain as what IEEE was for the internet.  IEEE standards made for robust and efficient networks that work beautifully and it's time we do the same for our supply chain.
More importantly, a Trust Architect is implementing a system that will create a race to the top.
