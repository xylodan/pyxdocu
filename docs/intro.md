# Welcome to the Pyx Community

Join us in revolutionizing global supply chains through the United Nations Transparency Protocol (UNTP). Our community is the nexus where innovation meets sustainability, driving profitability for forward-thinking businesses.<a href="7"/>

## Pyx Community = You + Knowledge Base + Forum {#pyx-community}

We're building a collaborative ecosystem of industry leaders, developers, and sustainability champions. Through open-source tools and shared expertise, we're creating a more transparent, efficient, and interoperable global supply chain model that most industries can implement independently by using our free resources.<a href="9"/>

## Understanding Trust Architecture and UNTP {#understanding-trust-architecture}

Trust Architecture is our framework for aligning industry supply chains with UNTP standards. It's driven by Trust Architectsâ€”multidisciplinary professionals combining project management, process engineering, and software development skills. For some people, like us here at Pyx, Trust Architecture is all we do. More broadly, people in various roles across organizations and industry ecosystems will emerge as Trust Architects, whether they adopt this title or not. Scalability and sustainability benefit every person in our economy.<a href="11"/>

UNTP, developed by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), sets the standard for digital communication across diverse supply chains. Think of it as the IEEE of supply chain management - enabling seamless interaction across different systems and platforms while prioritizing transparency and efficiency.<a href="12"/>

Pyx goes beyond UNTP compliance, ensuring your data sovereignty. We facilitate faster, more efficient data sharing while protecting your proprietary information.<a href="13"/>

## Creating a Race to the Top {#race-to-the-top}

Current supply chain models fall short in credential verification, leading to greenwashing and fraudulent claims. Pyx's UNTP solution balances transparency with data protection, giving honest businesses the competitive edge they deserve.<a href="27"/>

Recent findings show that 40% of companies' environmental claims are exaggerated or deceptive. Pyx aims to empower the 60% of businesses already operating ethically, increasing their market share and creating a more sustainable economy.<a href="28"/>
