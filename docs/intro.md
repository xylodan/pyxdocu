# PYX UNTP Community

Let's briefly talk about UNTP and our Pyx Community.

## Pyx Community - Knowledge Base + Forum

What are we trying to achieve in our Internet space?  A vibrant community dedicated to open source solutions to the existential problems that we face globally.  We are all about sustainability here.  We want to create a home for everyone looking to deliver results to meet that goal.

### Knowledge Base

You are in the Pyx Knowledge Base space right now and you can think of this as the library.
- Explanations for what a Trust Architect is and accompanying instructions to help them drive global value chain improvements.
- Detailed Instructions for developers implementing UNTP.
- Articles by the Pyx Team and Community members sharing best practices and success stories related to their UNTP efforts.

### Pyx Forums

If the Knowledge Base is our library, the Forums are the lounge where we gather, discuss and make friends.
- Interactive discussions with Pyx and Community members on how to solve unique problems not currently covered in our documentation.
- Feedback on published Pyx instructions as we aim to deliver the most comprehensive set of tools to empower any team to be able to complete their own UNTP implementation.
- A place where friendships can be made.  What good is a beautiful planet with sustainable practices if we don't create friendships along the way?

## What is UNTP

United Nations Transparency Protocol is a technology framework established to create a scalable, interoperable, and sustainable supply chain model to enhance efficiency and transparency.  A key pillar of Pyx solution to UNTP compliance puts a strong emphasis on data sovereignty.  That means the tools we share here are available for all to downloand and modify and apply to their own value chain processes.

The inefficiency of current models have resulted in shortcomings in verification of credentials and the ability to get away with dishonesty related to stated environmental claims.  This leads to the rampant trend of greenwashing, counterfeiting of goods and dishonest claims being made which are hurting our most reputable and sustainable supply chain teams.  Pyx solution to UNTP addresses the need for regulatory information to be transparent while recognizing that proprietary information must be protected.  Pyx recognizes that data sovereignty is paramount as we shift to these more sustainable models where transparency is applied to the information that is required while protecting proprietary data.

## Welcome To Our Digital Home

Thank you for stopping by and learning more about our UNTP solution.  With the combined resources of our Community Forum and experience in data engineering, we aim to provide the most comprehensive and actionable resource for those looking to implement UNTP while understanding the importance of maintaining data sovereignty.
